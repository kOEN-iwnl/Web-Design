        I remember seeing this class as a possible choice when I was choosing my classes for 9th grade. I did ask around what web design was about, and I got a similar answer: Learn how Google is coded, and code your own. I decided to take the course thinking that I was going to be the next web designer for companies. I expected to learn many fun things, so I looked forward to taking this class.

        Now that I'm almost done with this semester of web design, I can't believe how far I have come! While I did not reach my expectation of being the next web designer, I enjoyed learning the basics of creating a webpage. I also found it fun working with friends when trying  to create webpages. Overall, I really enjoyed learning something that is out of the ordinary, and found it as a possible skill I can use in the future.

        Plans for the Future

        In terms of plans for the future, I am definetly taking this class next semester. I decided to do a year full of web design since I thought it was fun. In my own time, I might just use these newly learned skills to create websites. While I like a lot of gaming, I thought I might be cool if I created my own site where I uploaded highlights and messages. In conclusion, I will use these skills in my own meantime to create my own things.
