<h1 style="font-family: times>Upgrading my PC</h1>
<h2>Aaron Kuo</h2>

Well back-to-school sale is nearly over, but I still have some shopping to do.
I plan on building/upgrading my pc, and it needs to be a bit faster. Considering the hardware I was using previously
was getting slow and sluggish, and couldn't handle some of the more intensive things I do now. My old pc
is equiped with a Intel Core I5-4500k, with 8GB of ram. The graphics card is a Nvidia Geforce GTX 960, but it's not able to handle
some of the games I'm playing.
<p>
My shopping cart is filled with new hardware. The only thing I"m keeping from old computer is the motherboard, Asus Rampage VI, and the power
supply Corsair 1100i. My new case is a full-tower, and will be housing a I7-7700k, 32 GB of ram, 2 GTX1060 in SLI, and 3tb of SSD storage.
I'm looking forward to having a new computer.
