      Besides providing a high standard education system, Morrison Academy Taichung also provides state of the art facilities for the performance arts. We encourage our students to not only pursue academics, but also to balance their life with the arts.

      Morrison Academy has an extensive music program, with three options for our students: band, choir, and orchestra. Each music program has its own music classroom, with highly qualified instructors. Not only do we have an excellent music program, we also have an auditorium to hold talks, activities, and performances in.

    <p>
    In the year of 2015, Morrison Academy renovated our old cafeteria and changed it into the current art building. This is where our students participate in art programs, which include painting and pottery.
